#summary Creating appointments and adding to the Calendar

= Create an Appointment =

The following code snippet demonstrates how to create and add an appointment to the calendar widget. Every time an appointment is added to the calendar widget the layout is re-calculated and performed.

{{{
Appointment appt = new Appointment();
appt.setStart(...);
appt.setEnd(...);
appt.setTitle(...);
appt.addStyleName("gwt-appointment-blue");
calendar.addAppointment(appt);
}}}

== appointments in batch ==

As stated earlier, every time an appointment is added to the calendar widget the layout is re-calculated. If you plan to add many appointments at once you should suspend the layout and then resume it once you are complete:

{{{
calendar.suspendLayout();

//load 1,000 appointments into calendar
for(int i=0;i<1000;i++) {
	Appointment appt = new Appointment();
	...
	calendar.addAppointment(appt);
}

calendar.resumeLayout();
}}}


== appointment style ==

When adding appointments you provide it with a style that defines its color palette. Use the `addStyleName` method. Examples are: `gwt-appointment-blue`, `gwt-appointment-green`

Here is a table of appointment styles and the themes that support them:
