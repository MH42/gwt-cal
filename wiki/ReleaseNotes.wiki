  * Click time block to create new appointment, [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-cal/issues/detail?id=7 Issue #9]

`**`This is just a preview of what's to come. There is quite a bit more work to do on all/multi-day appointments. Anders Lundgren has been kind enough to provide a patch for very flexible all/multi-day appointment rendering. We are working to integrate these changes with a number of structural changes required to enable multiple views (i.e. month view, list view) and drag drop functionality.
