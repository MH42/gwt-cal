#summary Applying themes to the gwt-cal widget.

= Applying Themes =

The gwt-library includes a set of themes to style the calendar widget. The desired theme must be inherited in the `<your application>.gwt.xml` module file.

{{{
  <!-- inherit this module for a Google look and feel -->
  <inherits name='com.bradrydzewski.gwt.calendar.theme.google.Google' />

  <!-- inherit this module for an Outlook look and feel -->
  <inherits name='com.bradrydzewski.gwt.calendar.theme.outlook.Outlook' />

  <!-- inherit this module for an iCal look and feel -->
  <inherits name='com.bradrydzewski.gwt.calendar.theme.ical.iCal' />
}}}

To achieve a more authentic iCal look and feel you should also set the following property in the `CalendarSetting` class.
{{{
settings.setOffsetHourLabels(true);
calendar.setSettings(settings);
}}}

`**`Outlook theme support is not yet included in 0.9. We may exclude completely since the Outlook 2000 look and feel is a bit outdated.
